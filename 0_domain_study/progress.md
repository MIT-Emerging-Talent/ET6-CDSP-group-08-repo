## Our Actionable Research Question

> _How have armed conflicts over the past 25 years
affected the deployment, capacity utilization,
and household consumption of solar photovoltaic systems in conflict‐affected communities?_

## Constraints

- Geographical and Seasonal Limitations
  - Limited sunlight hours and seasonal variation in some regions
- Financial Barriers
  - High initial cost of solar panel installation
- Infrastructure Challenges
  - Lack of storage infrastructure (e.g. batteries)
- Energy Access Disparities
  - Uneven access to renewable energy across urban and rural areas
- Time Constraints
  - Time limit of 12 weeks for research
- Knowledge Requirements
  - Requires basic domain knowledge in climate science and energy policy

## Project Scope

- **Time Period:** 25 years
- **Renewable Energy Theme:** Solar Energy

  _Why Solar Energy?_

  - **Fast & Flexible:** Easy to deploy, remove, and scale
     — from single homes to entire camps.  
  - **Off-Grid Ready:** Operates independently of central
     power infrastructure.  
  - **Data-Rich:** Ample data on solar use and conflict
     impacts enables robust analysis.  
  - **High Impact:** Enhances resilience, reduces emissions,
     and improves daily life in conflict zones.

- **Regions:** Syria, Iraq, Sudan, South Sudan, Palestine, Mali, Ethiopia,
  Ukraine, Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Central African Republic,
  Somalia,Pakistan, Mozambique and Myanmar (17 countries)
