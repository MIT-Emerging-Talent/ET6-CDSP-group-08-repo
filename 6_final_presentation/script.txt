Hello everyone,
At the end of this presentation, you will know how solar affects conflicted communities. (next please)

We, Group 8, are interested in the world of energy and sustainable development, as we have personally experienced the very energy challenges we are working to address. This took us to an amazing realization—that solar is not just climate tech, but also a survival infrastructure. Understanding this pattern will help policymakers act in the right window to maximize impact. (next please)

Some of the major limitations we faced are that “installed” capacity doesn’t always mean it’s actually being used, due to the black market and second-hand use.
Also, we pivoted and made changes to address the *full cycle of conflict*—from pre, active, to post—over 25 years in 17 countries. (next please)

As our research question stated… (next please)

We actually interpreted that solar grows faster *during* conflict, not after.
We also found how policies, wealth, and conflict duration affect adoption patterns. (next please)

The crisis of power outages in Sudan is critical—it has been absent for months or only sporadic.
The problem is not viewed through a holistic approach, and there is little focus on essential public services—from clinics to schools to water pumps—remaining dependent on diesel generators, while solar becomes 57% more expensive. (next please)

Our solution is **“The Solar Pilot Kit.”**
We aim to partner with elected committees, design with community needs in mind, and train locals to maintain and manage systems—focusing on sustainable public services and building a survival infrastructure. (next please)

The partners are trusted local leaders, with deep knowledge of their community’s needs. They are service-oriented, ensuring long-term maintenance and true community ownership. (next please)

This makes us ask for support that goes beyond financial funding.
We are asking for help in launching our pilot, with project management and technical implementation—moving towards a refugee-led solution. (next please)

And lastly, meet our team—
With a big shoutout to Abdalla Alnajjar, who was a great contributor to our group but unfortunately left the program due to the ongoing conflicts and energy challenges he faced in Gaza. (next please)

It has been a great journey and a pleasure discovering and working on all this together.
Together, we can build a resilient community!
