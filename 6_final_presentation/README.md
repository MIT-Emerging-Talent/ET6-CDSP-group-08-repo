# [Final Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ylyQKWaLEG2DBNjNC2kAqbokFimr2Ajq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106464215390283406640&rtpof=true&sd=true)  

## Slide 01 : Team & Title  
- **Project Title**: *Solar Energy in Conflict Zones*  
- **Funders**: Refugee-led Innovation Fund  
- **Group Name**: GROUP 08 – CDSP PROJECT  

---

## Slide 02 : Our Story  
- _Displaced. Determined. Data-Driven._  
- “We lived through the very energy challenges we are trying to solve.”  
- > Solar energy acts as a survival infrastructure in conflicted communities – not just an environmental solution.  

---

## Slide 03 : Research Challenges  
- Installed ≠ actually used (black market, second-hand issues).  
- Gaps in data: missing years, distorted import stats.  
- Pivoted to study **entire conflict cycle** (pre, active, post) across 25 years, 17 countries.  

---

## Slide 04 : Research Question  
- **Main Question**: How have armed conflicts over the past 25 years influenced the deployment and adoption of solar photovoltaic systems?  
- **Findings**:  
  - Solar grows faster *during* conflict, not only after.  
  - Policies, wealth, and conflict duration shape adoption.  

---

## Slide 05 : Sudan Case Study – Energy Crisis  
- **Critical power outages**: months-long blackouts.  
- **Essential services** (clinics, schools, water pumps) still rely on diesel.  
- **Barrier**: Solar 57% more expensive than diesel.  

---

## Slide 06 : The Solar Pilot Kit  
- Modular, durable solar system for **public services**.  
- Designed with community needs in mind.  
- Training locals to **maintain and manage**.  
- > From individual use → collective, survival infrastructure.  

---

## Slide 07 : Partners & Community Ownership  
- Elected committees as trusted partners.  
- Deep knowledge of community needs.  
- Focus on **service-oriented, long-term maintenance**.  
- Community-led ownership model.  

---

## Slide 08 : What We’re Asking For  
- Support that goes **beyond financial aid**.  
- Funding to launch the pilot.  
- Assistance with project management & technical expertise.  
- > Towards a **refugee-led solution**.  

---

## Slide 09 : Our Team  
- Group 08 members.  
- Shoutout: **Abdalla Alnajjar**, who contributed significantly but had to leave due to the conflict in Gaza.  

---

## Slide 10 : Closing  
- A journey of discovery and collaboration.  
- > Together, we can build resilient communities!
