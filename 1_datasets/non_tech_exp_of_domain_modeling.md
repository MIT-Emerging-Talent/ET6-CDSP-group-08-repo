## Domain Modeling (non-technical explanation)

Imagine trying to understand how people survive in war-torn areas when the lights go out — literally. That’s where our project begins. We built something called a **domain model**, which is just a fancy way of saying: _"Let’s draw a simple map to make sense of a really messy situation."_

At the center of it all is **solar energy** — not just as a clean tech solution, but as a **lifeline** when everything else fails. When power lines are bombed, families are displaced, and normal life disappears, solar can step in as **survival infrastructure** — helping people charge phones, power lights, and keep hospitals or schools running. We're looking at things like:

To understand how this all works, we looked at three big clues (datasets):

- **On-Grid and Off-Grid Data** _tells us how traditional electricity drops off during conflict. It’s like tracking where the lights go out and shows how people start using solar systems when the grid fails — kind of like switching from the main power to a backup generator._
- **Renewable and Non-Renewables** _helps us compare how energy use shifts in crisis: are countries using more solar or still relying on fossil fuels_
- **UN Comtrade Data** _tracks the flow of solar equipment (like panels and batteries) into countries over time, revealing how conflict affects supply chains and access to solar tech._

Our domain model focuses on three main areas:

  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 70%;">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Survival Infrastructure"</strong>: We're looking at <em>solar PV</em> as a <em>fundamental tool for human survival</em> - not just another <em>green tech solution</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict Lifecycle</strong>: We break down solar's role across the <em>pre-conflict, active conflict, and post-conflict phases</em> – because its utility changes drastically through each.</li>
        <li><strong>Three Pillars of Impact</strong>: To get measurable, we're zeroing in on <strong>Deployment Patterns, Capacity Utilization, and Household Consumption</strong>. These are our core measurable areas, directly feeding into our main research question.</li>
      </ul>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, let’s be real — collecting data in conflict zones is **really hard**. A lot of info is missing, unreliable, or never even written down (what we call **“dark data”**). So sometimes we have to connect the dots using smart guesses — like using import numbers as a hint for solar activity.

In the end, our domain model is like the gameboard that helps us play this complex game: **What happens to energy when everything else falls apart — and how can solar make things better?**
