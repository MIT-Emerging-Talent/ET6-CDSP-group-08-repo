**Welcome aboard the CDSP Group 08 Repository!**   🌌  
_Displaced. Determined. Data-Driven._

## M0: Project Overview

We are a team united by _purpose and shaped by displacement_, using data science
 to **drive real-world impact.** This project applies data exploration, modeling,
 and visualization to explore how renewable energy, specifically **solar energy** (i.e. PV cells),
 serves as _critical survival infrastructure in conflict-affected communities_ worldwide.

## [M1: Domain Research & Background](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/blob/main/0_domain_study/README.md)

> [Solar Energy acts as a vital **survival infrastructure** in conflict zones.](https://www.pv-tech.org/how-solar-can-bring-light-to-war-zones/)

Citizens in conflict-affected countries require stable electricity sources,
yet ongoing clashes and targeted attacks on power infrastructure have
severely disrupted their access to reliable power.   
This project examines how solar photovoltaic systems function [not as 
environmental solutions](https://www.csis.org/analysis/gazas-solar-power-wartime), but as **critical survival technology** that 
enables families to maintain essential services when all
other energy sources fail.

#### The Humanitarian Energy Crisis

Armed conflicts create immediate survival challenges that go 
far beyond traditional security concerns. As of 2024, over [130 million people](https://www.unhcr.org/global-trends)
worldwide have been forcibly displaced by war, persecution, and disaster,
including 37.6 million refugees and 68.3 million internally displaced persons. 
While humanitarian responses typically prioritize food, shelter, and medical 
care, these essential services all depend on 
one critical resource: **reliable energy access**.

The energy reality for conflict-affected communities is stark. 
Nearly [90%](https://unepccc.org/project/sustainable-energy-use-in-refugee-camps/) of refugee settlements lack reliable electricity access,
forcing families to rely on dangerous and inadequate alternatives.
Over [80%](https://energypedia.info/wiki/Energy_Access_in_Displacement_Settings) of displaced populations still depend on firewood or biomass
for cooking, exposing women and girls to safety risks while contributing
to indoor air pollution that kills millions annually.
This energy poverty doesn't just [limit comfort](https://www.unhcr.org/in/sites/en-in/files/legacy-pdf/4a1d2f422.pdf), it directly threatens
survival by compromising medical services, water access, communication
systems, and basic safety through adequate lighting.

#### Solar PV as Critical Survival Technology

In this context, solar photovoltaic systems have emerged not as environmental
solutions, **but as survival infrastructure**. Unlike centralized power grids
that become primary targets during conflicts, distributed solar systems
offer resilient, locally-controlled energy that can function
independently of broader infrastructure networks.

The deployment patterns reveal this survival imperative clearly.
Gaza provides the most compelling example: despite ongoing
conflict, the territory maintains an estimated [12,400 rooftop 
solar installations](https://www.csis.org/analysis/gazas-solar-power-wartime). This is likely the highest concentration 
globally relative to population size. These systems were 
not installed for environmental reasons but out of necessity,
as Gaza residents received grid power for only 6-8 hours 
daily even before the current crisis. Solar now accounts
for more than 50% of the territory's electricity production,
powering essential services from medical clinics to water pumping systems.

Similarly, in Afghanistan, solar deployment increased during 
conflict periods specifically because it was "the only
approach based on [economics and reducing risks](https://ases.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hybrid-Solar-Power-in-Afghanistan-War-Zone-%E2%80%93-Unique-Engineering-and-Economic-Factors-.pdf) to personnel
in a war zone". Mobile clinics, field hospitals, and 
communication systems rely on solar power when traditional
energy infrastructure fails or becomes too dangerous to maintain.

### Research Gap & Critical Knowledge Needs

Despite growing recognition of solar energy's role
in conflict zones, significant knowledge gaps 
remain about how armed conflicts specifically
affect three critical dimensions of solar deployment:

1. <details><summary><b>Deployment Patterns</b></summary><p>How do conflict dynamics influence where,
    when, and why households and communities install solar PV systems?
    Do installations increase during active conflict due to grid
    failures, or decrease due to economic constraints and physical dangers?</p></details>

2. <details><summary><b>Capacity Utilization</b></summary><p>How effectively do solar systems operate
    under conflict conditions? Evidence from Gaza shows that 64.8%
    of solar panels have been damaged by ongoing hostilities, yet families
    continue using compromised systems because they provide essential survival
    power.</p></details>

3. <details><summary><b>Household Consumption</b></summary><p>How do energy consumption patterns
    change when families transition from grid dependence
    to solar-powered systems during conflicts? What services do
    households prioritize when energy becomes scarce and self-generated?</p></details>
---

## [Research Question & Objectives](0_domain_study/progress.md)

### Research Question

> **How have armed conflicts over the past 25 years influenced the deployment,
> capacity utilization, and household consumption of solar photovoltaic
> systems—both environmentally and socially—in conflict-affected communities?**

#### Research Focus & Significance

By examining the relationships between conflict intensity,
solar system adoption rates, capacity factors, and 
household energy consumption patterns, we can better 
understand how families adapt their energy strategies 
for survival. The findings will inform humanitarian energy planning, 
post-conflict reconstruction efforts, and resilient 
infrastructure design for communities facing ongoing
security challenges.

<details><summary><b>Why This Matters?</b></summary>

- Solar energy offers fast, decentralized, and life-saving power in conflict-affected areas,
  where [675 million](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy/overview) people still lack electricity. This technology empowers vulnerable
  communities by delivering resilience, dignity, and sustainable
  energy infrastructure during [humanitarian crises.](https://solgenpower.com/2023/10/10/the-benefits-of-solar-energy-for-humanitarian-aid/)

- Solving this problem could provide life-saving infrastructure
 in unstable regions, promote energy equity, and support
 long-term [sustainable development goals.](https://www.hhs.se/sv/om-oss/news/news-from-misum/2016/sdgs-in-conflict/)

- The humanitarian community and affected populations
 increasingly recognize the need for resilient [sustainable
 and decentralized energy solutions in conflicted areas](https://www.cyis.org/post/renewable-energy-in-conflict-zones-protecting-war-torn-environments)</details>

### Project Scope

### [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/blob/main/1_datasets/non_tech_exp_of_domain_modeling.md)
Imagine trying to understand how people survive in war-torn areas when the lights go out — literally. That’s where our project begins.   

At the center of it all is **solar energy** — not just as a clean tech solution, but as a **lifeline** when everything else fails. When power lines are bombed, families are displaced, and normal life disappears, solar can step in as **survival infrastructure** — helping people charge phones, power lights, and keep hospitals or schools running. We're looking at things like:

  - Renaming columns for consistency  


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Data Exploration</strong></summary>

Understanding trends in solar capacity deployment, trade patterns, and energy access in conflict-affected countries.  
 The analysis revealed unexpected insights, such as rapid solar adoption in war zones and significant disparities between conflict and comparison countries. We visualized capacity growth, explored outliers, and identified key data limitations. While the datasets are valuable, a more complete picture requires integrating conflict timelines and socioeconomic indicators.

</details>

* **Overall Insights**

  * Conflict disrupts but does not prevent solar adoption.
  * Solar development can surge during brief periods of stability.
  * Additional data on conflict intensity and socioeconomic factors is needed for deeper analysis.

## [M3: Data Analysis](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/tree/main/4_data_analysis)

Investigating how solar energy deployment changes across different **phases of conflict, economic statuses, duration, technology types and both environmental and social impact** in different conflict-affected countries ( 2000–2024 ); using IRENA and UN Comtrade datasets, analyzing on-grid/off-grid capacity, import trends, and conflict timelines.

#### Key Insights

Conflict periods are often associated with increased solar energy adoption..
- Conflict does not automatically suppress development; but as **windows of opportunity** existing even in fragile settings.
- **Recovery capacity** varies widely; some countries rebound with aid or reform, others remain paralyzed.
- Strategic, resilient infrastructure development is possible, but often hinges on **timing, governance, and stability**.
- Three-way link between **conflict duration, economic status, and solar adoption**—where _conflict increases the need, GDP shapes capacity, and policy ensures sustainability_

 <details><summary><b>Overall Pattern</b></summary><p>

**On Sudan:**  
**_Grid power came first:_** By 2018, on-grid non-solar power reached full capacity, mainly from hydropower and thermal sources like the Merowe and Roseires Dams.  
**_Solar followed slowly:_** Off-grid solar expanded gradually, reaching capacity by 2021 amid post-2019 instability and weak rural infrastructure.  

In Sudan (2010–2023), off-grid solar deployment rises steadily, unlike on-grid deployment, which increases sporadically—likely tied to major government projects. Off-grid growth stagnates in 2022–2023, possibly due to missing data. The dataset likely fails to capture actual declines, especially for on-grid deployment, limiting the accuracy of year-to-year comparisons in the later period.

**On Ukraine:**  
**Moderate correlation** (r = 0.343); Imports typically occur in short bursts, followed by gradual deployment increases, especially between 2014–2019. Post-2019 declines in imports and 2024 deployment drops likely reflect conflict impacts.

> 
 <details><summary><b>Overall Pattern</b></summary><p>

- **Imports rise during conflicts** in countries like Syria, Yemen, and Ukraine, reflecting increased demand for alternative energy.  
  _→ Conflict often damages centralized power grids, increasing reliance on imported solar products as emergency energy solutions._

- **Conflict-period imports** often exceed pre- and post-conflict levels.  
  _→ During active conflict, demand for decentralized and backup power sources spikes, especially in humanitarian or survival contexts._

- **Stable countries** show more **gradual and steady import growth**.  
  _→ Without urgent disruption, energy transitions in stable countries tend to follow policy-driven, long-term investment plans._

- **PV Modules** dominate overall imports.  
  _→ PV panels are the core component of solar systems, making them the foundation of any solar energy deployment strategy._

- **Solar Lamps** and **Lithium Batteries** have a **larger share during conflicts**, indicating a need for portable power.  
  _→ In emergencies, small-scale, off-grid solutions are critical for lighting, communication, and basic household use — especially when grid access is unreliable._

- **Inverters** and **Lead-Acid Batteries** maintain **smaller, steady shares**.  
  _→ These components support more permanent solar setups, which are harder to install or maintain during unstable conditions._

### Key Conclusions

- **Solar capacity grows during conflict**, especially in lower-income countries.
- **Off-grid systems** surge in fragile settings, likely due to humanitarian support.
- **Solar imports correlate** with deployment in some contexts (e.g., Ethiopia), but **not reliably**.

### Confidence Level

We are **moderately confident** in the trends observed. Core patterns appear consistent across countries, but some data gaps and contextual complexities limit certainty.

### Limitations

- Data gaps in post-conflict years and low-income countries.
- Imports ≠ direct deployment; stockpiling or re-exports possibles.(black markets or secondhand use)
- No modeling of lag effects between import and deployment.
- Conflict phase definitions are simplified proxies.

<details><summary><b>Future work</b></summary><p>

- Use maps or data showing how intense conflict is in different areas.
- Study if there's a delay between importing equipment and solar growth.
- Compare solar projects funded by aid vs. those driven by local markets.
- Check the results against real project data or insights from local experts.
