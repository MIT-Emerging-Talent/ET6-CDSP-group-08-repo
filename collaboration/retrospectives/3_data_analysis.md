# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- **Avoid dividing work based on datasets.**  
  This approach caused fragmentation and confusion. Instead, focus on analytical
   questions to guide the division of tasks.

## Continue Doing

- **Continue improving previous work.**  
  Revisit and refine steps such as data cleaning and exploration to ensure high
   quality and consistency.

- **Add more data when needed.**  
  Supplement existing datasets if gaps are discovered or deeper insights are required.

- **Split tasks fairly and communicate regularly.**  
  Divide tasks clearly and check in often to identify blockers or support teammates.

## Start Doing

- **Define and assign tasks based on analytical questions.**  
  This makes the work more goal-oriented and easier to interpret.

- **Document assumptions, choices, and issues.**  
  Maintain a shared log to improve transparency and help future reviews or debugging.

- **Implement regular peer reviews.**  
  Set checkpoints to review each other's work and give constructive feedback
   before finalizing.

- **Clarify responsibilities at the start of each phase.**  
  Make sure everyone understands their roles and deliverables early to reduce confusion.

- **Track progress using visual tools (e.g., Kanban or checklist).**  
  This helps everyone stay aligned and aware of the overall workflow.

## Lessons Learned

- Dividing tasks by analytical questions ensures clearer focus and better outcomes.
- Strong team communication and early problem reporting prevent major setbacks.
- Going back to refine earlier work (like cleaning or EDA) can save time and
   boost final quality.
- Flexibility is necessary — be ready to adapt when the original plan isn’t working.

## Strategy vs Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected

- Successfully improved earlier work and maintained consistency across steps.
- Team members communicated effectively and helped one another.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Dividing tasks by dataset caused overlap and lack of clarity.
- Some important analysis steps were missed due to unclear responsibilities.

### Did you need to add things that weren’t in your strategy or remove extra steps?

- Yes. We added extra effort to clean and align earlier tasks.
- We shifted the task-division approach from dataset-based to analytical question–based.
- Removed some duplicate or unclear steps that didn't contribute to the core goals.
  
## Individual retrospectives

### Ahd

### **What Went Well**

Started early with working on data exploration 2 and critically think how to
 work on an analysis question and use my data accordingly
A lot of going back and forth with data and the exploration

### **What Didn’t Go as Planned**

Confusion of what is data analysis and what is data exploration
Starting with dividing analysis according to datasets again but turns out
 choosing data analysis questions related to the main question regardless of the
  datasets

### **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy? Or remove extra steps?**

Just had a call with Evan that clarified a lot of questions and confusions

### Zeinab

### What Went Well

- Contributed to improving previous work, especially in cleaning and exploring
   the data more deeply.
- Stayed committed to quality by reviewing earlier steps and identifying
   opportunities to refine and strengthen the analysis.
- Communicated effectively with the team and supported task coordination.

### What Didn’t Go as Planned

- Initially divided tasks based on datasets, which led to confusion and lack of
   clear direction.
- Realized later that dividing based on analytical questions makes more sense
   and provides clearer focus.

### Did You Need to Add Things That Weren’t in Your Strategy? Or Remove Extra Steps?

- Yes. I added more time for data cleaning and re-exploration to ensure accuracy
   and clarity.
- add more data to help make accurate analysis
- Removed unnecessary or duplicate steps that didn’t align with the main analysis
   goals.

### Mohamed Altayeb

### What Went Well

- Had a better understanding of the difference between data exploration and
  data analysis.
- Gained more experience with working with Jupyter Notebooks.

### What Didn’t Go as Planned

- Ongoing power blackout prevented me from properly contributing to the work
  this milestone>
- I wasn't able to do a deep enough analysis
  as I initially desired because of the time limitation and the power situation.
- I had to include only 4 countries in my analysis during the time frame
   of this milestone.

**Did You Need to Add Things That Weren’t In Your Strategy? Or Remove Extra Steps?**

- Divided the tasks based on analytical questions rather than data sets.
  This enabled us to work more individually and combine our results later.
- I had to reduce the complexity and scope of my analysis to
  comply with the time constrain.
