## Stop Doing  
- Spending too much time perfecting details that delayed progress.  
- Overextending on tasks outside our main project goals.  

## Continue Doing  
- Focusing on making an impact with our research and project outcomes.  
- Reaching out and connecting with people who are interested in our project and research.  
- Building on existing knowledge and “starting from where people end” to save time and add value.  

## Start Doing  
- Setting clearer timelines and sticking to them.  
- Sharing updates more frequently within the team for alignment.  
- Seeking feedback earlier in the process to adjust before final stages.  

## Lessons Learned  
- The Communication Strategy milestone required more time and effort than expected, showing us the importance of early planning.  
- Creating the pitch deck was very useful and became a strong foundation for our final presentation.  
- Collaboration and clear narrative made a big difference in how we delivered our work.

 The pitch deck turned out to be a strong tool for presenting ideas clearly.  
Our focus on impact and clarity helped guide the project direction.  

### What parts of your plan did not work out?  
- Collaboration and teamwork didn't flow smoothly, not everyone contributed.
- The Communication Strategy milestone took much longer than planned.  
- Some tasks were delayed because of spending too much time refining details.  
- It was challenging to keep the timeline balanced with all deliverables.  

### Did you need to add things that weren’t in your strategy or remove extra steps?  
- Added extra effort on presentation design, which wasn’t originally emphasized but proved crucial.  
- Removed or simplified smaller research details to stay focused on the main goals.  
- Adjusted communication approaches (sharing more updates and feedback) as the project progressed.
