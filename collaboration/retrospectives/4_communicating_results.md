## Stop Doing
- Spending too much time detailing research methodology in the blog (it slowed us down).

## Continue Doing
- Continued working on the blog post with strong collaboration and clear narrative.  
- Using visuals and structured storytelling in the pitch deck.  
- Applying our research into concrete solutions (proposal + pilot idea).  
- Dividing work based on strengths (writing, design, data).  

## Start Doing
- Set clearer task ownership and deadlines earlier in the process.  
- Incorporate visuals (charts, diagrams) into the blog and proposal earlier.  
- Reach out to partners earlier to avoid delays.  
- Build in time for feedback rounds before finalizing deliverables.  

## Lessons Learned
- Simplicity and clarity make research communication more powerful than heavy detail.  
- Strong teamwork and clear division of roles help us finish on time.  
- Visual storytelling (in the deck and blog) makes a big difference in engaging the audience.  
- Early feedback and iteration can prevent last-minute edits.

## Strategy vs Board

### Ahd
**What parts of your plan went as expected**  
- Pitch deck was a huge success, and it will directly support drafting the final presentation.  

**What parts of your plan did not work out**  
- Partnering with a research center did not materialize within the milestone timeline.  

**Did you need to add or remove steps?**  
- Added a WhatsApp campaign with infographics for solar awareness.

### Mohamed Altayeb
**What parts of your plan went as expected**  
- The blog post, pitch deck, and proposal draft came out very well.  
- Each artifact was tailored to its audience and effectively conveyed the message.  

**What parts of your plan did not work out**  
- We missed the deadline for the UNHCR fund, so we couldn’t apply.  
- We haven’t yet found an organization to partner with for the pilot.  

**Did you need to add or remove steps?**  
- Targeting more than one audience with separate communication artifacts wasn’t in the initial plan, but it worked out very well.

### Maria Cedeño
**What parts of your plan went as expected**  
- The blog post was successful and went as planned.  

**What parts of your plan did not work out**  
- We were unable to apply for the UNHCR fund, but we learned a lot about the process.  

**Did you need to add or remove steps?**  
- For future steps, I’d like to create a full website for our project to better reach our audience.  
- I’d also like to open accounts on social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook).
