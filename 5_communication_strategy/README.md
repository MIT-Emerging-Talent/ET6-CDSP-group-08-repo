This strategy is designed to empower **Popular Committees in Sudan** to champion solar energy solutions for their communities.

## **Core Message**
**Solar power is not just about lights—it's about our community's future.**
- *"When the main power is cut, solar energy keeps our clinics running, our water pumps flowing, and our neighborhoods safe."*
- *"This isn't a temporary fix; it's a permanent solution that gives us control over our own essential services."*

---

## **Narrative: A Story for Our Community**

### **1. Beginning – The Problem We All Face**
- **Challenge:**
  - The official power grid is unreliable and often fails, especially during crises.
  - Diesel is expensive and hard to find; generators are loud and require constant maintenance.
  - This affects clinics, schools, and water supplies.
- **Misconception:**
  - Solar is for single homes or businesses only.
  - Perceived as too expensive or complex for public services.

<details>
<summary><b>
Current Situation  </b></summary>
  
- **Power Reliability:** In Khartoum and surrounding areas, grid outages average **1 - 7 days** during peak demand and crisis periods.
<details>
<summary><b>
  Duration Varies  </b></summary>
  
The length of power outages in Khartoum depends heavily on the specific circumstances.
- **Routine Unreliability:** Even in relatively stable times, the national grid is fragile. Daily outages of **12–16 hours** are common due to poor infrastructure and maintenance.
- **Peak Demand:** During the hot summer months, demand for cooling overwhelms the system, causing more frequent and longer blackouts.
- **Conflict and Crisis:** This is the most severe factor. When power stations or transmission lines are damaged by military action, the outages are not a matter of hours, but of days, weeks, and sometimes even months. Recent reports indicate that residents have been forced to take matters into their own hands, repairing damaged infrastructure themselves.
</details>

- **Diesel Dependence:**  
  - Diesel price (2025): ~**$2.10/litre**.  
  - A small clinic consumes **80–120 litres/month** just for refrigeration and lights.

- **Impact on Services:**
  - **Healthcare:** Vaccines spoil; night operations cancelled.  
  - **Water:** Pumps stop; residents carry water manually.  
  - **Education:** Evening classes cancelled due to lack of light.  
</details>

### **2. Middle – The New Discovery**
- **Evidence:** Successful solar adoption exists in parts of Sudan and elsewhere.
- **Reality:** Small, durable solar systems outperform the central grid, especially during crises.
- **Opportunity:** Replace costly diesel generators with community-owned solar solutions.

### **3. End – The Call to Action**
- **Implication:** Solar is vital infrastructure for resilience and self-sufficiency.
- **Action:** Popular Committees to lead as champions of solar adoption.

<summary><b>
2. General Public </b></summary>

**Who they are**: Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees for Local Service Delivery and Community Administration in Sudan.  

**What They Do:** These are community-based bodies, 
typically formed at the neighborhood or village level,
to manage and coordinate essential local affairs in the
absence or weakness of formal state institutions.
They are often responsible for basic service delivery
(such as water, electricity, and sanitation),
issuing residence certificates, resolving local disputes,
organizing community security efforts,
and mobilizing resources through voluntary contributions.  

**Their Goals and Aims:** Their main purpose is to serve as a link between regulatory bodies,
government agencies, aid organizations, and the members of the communities they represent.
In contexts like Sudan, these committees can play a vital governance role—especially
during periods of crisis or when state presence is limited.  

**Their Scientific Background:** As committee members are elected from within the community,
their educational and scientific backgrounds can vary significantly.
However, it is generally expected that most of them have at least
a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, which should
make it possible to communicate findings and results effectively.
Most also have access to smartphones and the internet and are comfortable using them.  

**Their Background on Solar Energy:** Solar energy is already
recognized as a resilient solution to Sudan’s energy challenges.
However, its use has been mostly limited to individual
applications—such as private homes or services provided by
the private sector. It has not yet been widely adopted for
public services such as health, education, or agriculture.
In these sectors, communities still rely primarily on diesel
generators, as they are more familiar and accessible.  

#### **What we expect from them:**  
- Raise awareness about the benefits of solar
  energy for public services (schools, clinics, water pumps).
- Dispel common misconceptions
  (e.g., solar is only for homes, or it’s too expensive to maintain).
- Encourage collective acceptance of solar projects.
- Highlight locations and institutions
  where solar infrastructure would have the highest impact.
- Encourage community contributions
  (financial or in-kind) to expand deployment.
- Coordinate between communities,implementing partners,
  and government agencies to enable smooth deployment.
- Organize community meetings or forums for
  project planning and decision making.
tain communication with updates and invitations for joint activities.
</details>

### **The Audience: Popular Committees in Sudan**
- Community-led groups that handle essential services in neighborhoods and villages.  
- Function as local governing bodies when the formal government is weak or absent.  
- Crucial for managing **water, electricity, and sanitation**.  
- Serve as the bridge between the community and outside groups such as aid organizations.

### **Their Background & Skills**
- **Diverse but Capable:**  
  - Members are elected from the community with varied backgrounds.  
  - Expected to have a basic understanding of math and statistics to interpret project data and results.  
- **Tech-Savvy:**  
  - Comfortable using smartphones and the internet.  
  - Ideal partners for communication, data sharing, and digital collaboration.

### **Their View on Solar Energy**
- **Awareness but Limited Use:**  
  - Recognize solar as a resilient solution for Sudan's challenges.  
  - Mostly familiar with its application for individual homes or small businesses.  
- **The Barrier:**  
  - Limited adoption for **public services** such as clinics, schools, or water pumps.  
  - Continued reliance on costly, unreliable diesel generators.  
  - Challenge: Shift the perspective toward a **collective, public-service** approach to solar power.
