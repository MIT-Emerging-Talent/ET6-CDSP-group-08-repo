This strategy is designed to empower **Popular Committees in Sudan** to champion solar energy solutions for their communities.

## **Core Message**
**Solar power is not just about lights—it's about our community's future.**
- *"When the main power is cut, solar energy keeps our clinics running, our water pumps flowing, and our neighborhoods safe."*
- *"This isn't a temporary fix; it's a permanent solution that gives us control over our own essential services."*

---

## **Narrative: A Story for Our Community**

### **1. Beginning – The Problem We All Face**

- **Challenge:**
  - Khartoum’s power grid is unreliable and frequently fails, especially during crises.
  - Diesel is costly, difficult to obtain, and dependent on noisy, high-maintenance generators.
  - These issues disrupt essential services such as clinics, schools, and water supply.

- **Misconception:**
  - Many believe solar is only suitable for private homes or businesses.
  - It’s often perceived as too expensive or complicated for public infrastructure.

<details>
<summary><b>Current Situation</b></summary>

- **Power Reliability:**  
  In Khartoum and nearby areas, outages can last **1–7 days** during peak demand or crisis periods.

  <details>
  <summary><b>Duration Varies</b></summary>

  The length of blackouts depends on the situation:
  - **Routine Unreliability:** Even in stable periods, daily outages of **12–16 hours** are common due to poor infrastructure and maintenance.
  - **Peak Demand:** Hot summer months overwhelm the grid, causing longer and more frequent outages.
  - **Conflict & Crisis:** The most severe scenario — damage to power stations or transmission lines can cause outages lasting **days, weeks, or even months**.  
    In some cases, residents have had to repair damaged infrastructure themselves.
  </details>

- **Diesel Dependence:**  
  - Price (2025): ~**$2.10/litre**.  
  - A small clinic consumes **80–120 litres/month** just for refrigeration and lighting.

- **Impact on Services:**
  - **Healthcare:** Vaccines spoil; night operations are cancelled.  
  - **Water:** Pumps stop, forcing residents to fetch water manually.  
  - **Education:** Evening classes are cancelled due to lack of lighting.

</details>


### **2. Middle – The New Discovery**
- **Evidence:** Successful solar adoption exists in parts of Sudan and elsewhere.
- **Reality:** Small, durable solar systems outperform the central grid, especially during crises.
- **Opportunity:** Replace costly diesel generators with community-owned solar solutions.

### **3. End – The Call to Action**
- **Implication:** Solar is vital infrastructure for resilience and self-sufficiency.
- **Action:** Popular Committees to lead as champions of solar adoption.

<summary><b>
2. General Public </b></summary>

**Who they are**: Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees for Local Service Delivery and Community Administration in Sudan.  

**What They Do:** These are community-based bodies, 
typically formed at the neighborhood or village level,
to manage and coordinate essential local affairs in the
absence or weakness of formal state institutions.
They are often responsible for basic service delivery
(such as water, electricity, and sanitation),
issuing residence certificates, resolving local disputes,
organizing community security efforts,
and mobilizing resources through voluntary contributions.  

**Their Goals and Aims:** Their main purpose is to serve as a link between regulatory bodies,
government agencies, aid organizations, and the members of the communities they represent.
In contexts like Sudan, these committees can play a vital governance role—especially
during periods of crisis or when state presence is limited.  

**Their Scientific Background:** As committee members are elected from within the community,
their educational and scientific backgrounds can vary significantly.
However, it is generally expected that most of them have at least
a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, which should
make it possible to communicate findings and results effectively.
Most also have access to smartphones and the internet and are comfortable using them.  

**Their Background on Solar Energy:** Solar energy is already
recognized as a resilient solution to Sudan’s energy challenges.
However, its use has been mostly limited to individual
applications—such as private homes or services provided by
the private sector. It has not yet been widely adopted for
public services such as health, education, or agriculture.
In these sectors, communities still rely primarily on diesel
generators, as they are more familiar and accessible.  

#### **What we expect from them:**  
- Raise awareness about the benefits of solar
  energy for public services (schools, clinics, water pumps).
- Dispel common misconceptions
  (e.g., solar is only for homes, or it’s too expensive to maintain).
- Encourage collective acceptance of solar projects.
- Highlight locations and institutions
  where solar infrastructure would have the highest impact.
- Encourage community contributions
  (financial or in-kind) to expand deployment.
- Coordinate between communities,implementing partners,
  and government agencies to enable smooth deployment.
- Organize community meetings or forums for
  project planning and decision making.
tain communication with updates and invitations for joint activities.
