> üü° _**When the Grid Goes Dark, the Sun Keeps the Lights On**_

In conflict-affected areas, reliable energy isn‚Äôt a luxury ‚Äî it‚Äôs survival.  
As power grids fail, **solar quietly powers clinics, clean water, lights ‚Äî and hope**.

## Core Message
> _"Solar energy isn‚Äôt just green ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lifeline."_  
> ‚ÄúWhen the grid goes dark, a $10 solar lamp becomes the difference between isolation and connection.‚Äù

In war-torn regions, it powers what matters most: healthcare, safety, and communication.  
Even amidst destruction, **solar adoption surges** ‚Äî proving itself as *critical humanitarian infrastructure*.  
_It demonstrates surprising resilience and critical adaptation._

| **Why This Matters** |
|--------------------------|
| - _Humanitarian aid planning_ must treat energy as a **basic need** ‚Äî not an afterthought.<br>- For _governments_: decentralizing energy through solar isn‚Äôt just climate action ‚Äî **it‚Äôs conflict resilience planning.** |

## Narrative

### **1. Beginning ‚Äì The Problem**  
In conflict zones, energy systems fail. **90% of refugee settlements lack reliable electricity.**  
[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?font=Poppins&weight=500&size=14&pause=1000&color=D43737&vCenter=true&repeat=false&width=850&height=40&lines=%F0%9F%93%88+Solar+once+offered+hope+%E2%80%94+but+rising+costs+in+conflicted+communities+threaten+its+role+as+*survival+infrastructure*.)](https://git.io/typing-svg)
<details>
<summary><b>Solar energy is often seen as a cost-effective and scalable solution for energy access ‚Äî but in conflict zones, this promise is threatened by a range of economic and systemic challenges: </b></summary>

- **Solar is more expensive in conflict zones**  
  Even though solar is generally affordable worldwide, in areas affected by war or instability, solutions like solar kits can cost up to **57% more**, making them unaffordable for the communities that need them most. A relevant report is the [IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023)

- **People without electricity mostly live in these places**  
  An estimated **64% of people lacking electricity access live in conflict-affected regions**, meaning that high costs disproportionately impact the most vulnerable populations. The [World Bank's Energy Overview](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy/overview) states that "Eight out of 10 people without electricity today live in remote, fragile, or conflict-affected regions."

- **Investors see conflict zones as risky**  
  Due to **unstable governments**, **weak currencies**, and **political volatility**, investing in renewable energy in these regions is seen as high-risk and expensive. This discourages private sector involvement and leads to limited project implementation as stated in the paper ["The role of political risk in renewable energy investments: a developing country perspective"](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ea05d053748c4836f162eab825d84bb0fa47c2b3)

- **Humanitarian funding is falling short**  
  Traditional **grant-based aid is insufficient** for delivering sustainable solar solutions. Because energy is often categorized as a ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù goal rather than a humanitarian need, it receives **lower priority in emergency funding** ‚Äî despite being essential for survival. The [Humanitarian Energy Outlook 2023](https://www.humanitarianenergy.org/assets/resources/HEO_2023.pdf)
from the Global Platform for Action (GPA) discusses this.

- **Private companies don‚Äôt want to invest**  
  Many businesses avoid refugee or displacement settings, viewing them as **temporary** and **not commercially viable**, which further reduces investment in renewable energy for those communities. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) report ["Blended Finance Solutions for Clean Energy in Humanitarian and Displacement Settings"](https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/reports/blended-finance-solutions-for-clean-energy/blended-finance-solutions-for-clean-energy-in-humanitarian-and-displacement-settings.pdf) explains it.

These interconnected barriers threaten the role of solar energy as a reliable form of survival infrastructure in the very places where it‚Äôs needed most.

### **2. Middle ‚Äì The Discovery**  
Our data tells a surprising story:  
- **Solar adoption surges during conflict** ‚Äî contrary to expectations.
- **Off-grid tech (like lamps & batteries)** becomes more critical than large infrastructure.
- **Humanitarian response often overlooks energy**, despite its role in survival.


### 3. End ‚Äì The Implication  
Solar isn‚Äôt just green tech ‚Äî it‚Äôs **crisis tech**. But to fulfill its promise, it needs support.  

**Call to Action:**  
> Rethink energy aid. Prioritize solar access in fragile settings.

#### 3. General Public

**Who they are**: Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees for Local Service Delivery and Community Administration in Sudan.  

**What They Do:** These are community-based bodies, 
typically formed at the neighborhood or village level,
to manage and coordinate essential local affairs in the
absence or weakness of formal state institutions.
They are often responsible for basic service delivery
(such as water, electricity, and sanitation),
issuing residence certificates, resolving local disputes,
organizing community security efforts,
and mobilizing resources through voluntary contributions.  

**Their Goals and Aims:** Their main purpose is to serve as a link between regulatory bodies,
government agencies, aid organizations, and the members of the communities they represent.
In contexts like Sudan, these committees can play a vital governance role‚Äîespecially
during periods of crisis or when state presence is limited.  

**Their Scientific Background:** As committee members are elected from within the community,
their educational and scientific backgrounds can vary significantly.
However, it is generally expected that most of them have at least
a basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, which should
make it possible to communicate findings and results effectively.
Most also have access to smartphones and the internet and are comfortable using them.  

**Their Background on Solar Energy:** Solar energy is already
recognized as a resilient solution to Sudan‚Äôs energy challenges.
However, its use has been mostly limited to individual
applications‚Äîsuch as private homes or services provided by
the private sector. It has not yet been widely adopted for
public services such as health, education, or agriculture.
In these sectors, communities still rely primarily on diesel
generators, as they are more familiar and accessible.  

#### **What we expect from them:**  
- Raise awareness about the benefits of solar
  energy for public services (schools, clinics, water pumps).
- Dispel common misconceptions
  (e.g., solar is only for homes, or it‚Äôs too expensive to maintain).
- Encourage collective acceptance of solar projects.
- Highlight locations and institutions
  where solar infrastructure would have the highest impact.
- Encourage community contributions
  (financial or in-kind) to expand deployment.
- Coordinate between communities,implementing partners,
  and government agencies to enable smooth deployment.
- Organize community meetings or forums for
  project planning and decision making.
tain communication with updates and invitations for joint activities.
