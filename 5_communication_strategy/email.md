**Subject:** Collaboration Opportunity: Refugee-Led Innovation Fund Application  

Dear Fay Magid,  

I hope this email finds you well. My name is **Ahd Abdelrahim**, and I am reaching out on behalf of my team from the **MIT Emerging Talent program**.  

We are currently working on a project that addresses the **energy challenges faced by displaced communities**, specifically exploring how **solar energy** can serve not only as a sustainable technology but also as a survival infrastructure in conflict-affected areas. Our aim is to design **practical, community-driven solutions** that provide reliable energy access and restore dignity for displaced and underserved populations.  

We came across your impactful work with **IEEE** and believe your organization’s expertise and credibility would make you an invaluable partner as we prepare to apply for the **UNHCR Refugee-Led Innovation Fund (RLIF)**. Since only organizations are eligible to apply (not individuals), we are seeking a partnership with an established organization like IEEE to strengthen our proposal.  

If our work resonates with you, we would be honored to explore the possibility of collaborating under your organization’s name for the RLIF application. This would involve representing the project together, while we contribute the **research, proposal draft, and community-focused design** we have already developed.  

To give you more details, we have prepared:  
- A [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qtnTPDyECZFVlH4yhWlZRAuwwtspa7mvojq4XWrX1DM/edit?tab=t.0) outlining the fund, requirements, and our draft budget  
- A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo) where our research and progress are documented  
- A [pitch deck](https://solarenergyforcommunityresilienceinsudan.my.canva.site/) and [proposal](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/blob/main/5_communication_strategy/proposal.md) aligned with the UNHCR evaluation criteria  
- A [blog post](https://medium.com/@ahdbasan/survival-not-just-sustainability-the-role-of-solar-in-conflict-zones-54ef59c76af4) highlighting how solar energy provides resilience and dignity in conflict-driven blackouts  

The application deadline is **August 31, 2025**, so we would greatly appreciate hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.

We truly believe this project can make a meaningful impact, but to make it a reality, we need the support of an established organization like IEEE. If you find our work aligned with your mission, we would love to discuss possible next steps.  

Thank you for taking the time to consider this. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Warm regards,  
**Ahd Abdelrahim**
