# **Proposal: Solar Energy for Community Resilience in Sudan**

This proposal outlines a plan to
**empower Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees in Sudan**
to lead the adoption of solar energy as a vital survival
infrastructure for their communities.  

We seek **funding and support from the [UNHCR Refugee-led Innovation Fund](https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/refugee-led-innovation-fund/)** to launch a **pilot project in Khartoum, Sudan**.

## **1. Challenge Framing: The Energy Gap in Crisis (15%)**

The **official power grid in Sudan** is unreliable and frequently fails, particularly in conflict-affected areas. This instability forces communities to rely on **expensive, scarce, and high-maintenance diesel generators** for essential services.

While solar energy is recognized as a **resilient solution**, its use has been limited to **individual homes and private businesses**, largely overlooking critical public services like **clinics, schools, and water pumps**.

**Observed Impacts:**

- **Healthcare:** Without consistent power, vaccines spoil and clinics can’t operate after dark.
- **Water Supply:** Pumps stop, forcing residents to fetch water manually.
- **Education:** Evening classes are canceled due to lack of light.

Our team — **deeply rooted in the community** — aims to address this tangible, life-affecting challenge by introducing a **sustainable alternative** to diesel reliance.

## **2. Innovation: The “Solar Survival Kit” Pilot (30%)**

Our innovation lies not just in **solar technology**, but in the **application and management model** — using solar as a form of *“crisis infrastructure.”*

### **What It Is**

A **modular, durable solar power system** designed for **public institutions** (e.g., community clinics, water pumping stations).

### **What Makes It Innovative**

1. **Co-Creation with Committees**  
   - Kits will be designed **in collaboration** with Popular Committees to meet local needs.
2. **Community-Led Ownership**  
   - Committees will oversee **deployment, maintenance, and management**.
3. **Replicable Blueprint**  
   - A pilot that can be scaled to other neighborhoods in Sudan.

**Key Difference:**  
We focus on **collective, public-service applications** of solar energy — moving away from fragmented, individual use.

## **3. Community Leadership and Participation (20%)**

The **Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees** — elected community representatives — will lead this project.

### **Their Role**

- **Raise Awareness:**  
  Use **WhatsApp infographics** and **short videos** to educate and dispel solar myths.
- **Plan & Decide:**  
  Lead **community meetings** to select installation sites and encourage contributions.
- **Coordinate & Implement:**  
  Work with us and partners to ensure smooth deployment and resolve local challenges.

This **“by the community, for the community”** approach follows an **Age, Gender, and Diversity (AGD)** framework, ensuring representation of all demographics.

## **4. Implementation Details: A 18-Month Roadmap (15%)**

We request **up to $45,000 USD** for a **18-month pilot**.

### **Timeline**

- **Months 1–2: Co-Design & Mobilization**
  - Activities: Community meetings, finalize kit design, and launch contribution campaign.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Community-approved solar kit design; at least 3 sites (clinic, school, water pump) identified; contribution campaign launched with initial pledges.

- **Months 3–6: Training & Capacity Building**
  - Activities: Deliver a hands-on training program for committee members and community volunteers on solar panel operation, routine maintenance, and troubleshooting.
  - **Expected Outcome:** At least 20 local members trained and certified; a technical maintenance team formed; community ownership and readiness for installation established.

- **Months 7–10: Procurement & Installation**
  - Activities: Purchase and install solar kits in selected public institutions.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Fully installed solar systems in 3–5 public institutions; systems operational and providing reliable energy.

- **Months 11–14: Monitoring & Evaluation**
  - Activities: Track system performance, collect community feedback, and measure impact.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Performance data collected; at least 80% satisfaction reported by community users; documentation of lessons learned for improvement.

- **Months 15–18: Reporting & Dissemination**
  - Activities: Share findings with both the community and UNHCR, publish lessons learned, and highlight opportunities for scaling.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive final report submitted; findings shared through blogs/infographics; at least 2 dissemination meetings held with local leaders and stakeholders.

## **5. Impact, Sustainability, and Scale (20%)**

### **Impact**

- Reliable, affordable power for **critical public services**.
- Direct benefits to **hundreds of households**.
- Examples:  
  - **Clinic:** Uninterrupted healthcare services.  
  - **Water Pump:** Continuous access to clean water.

### **Sustainability**

- Committees trained for **management and maintenance**.
- Creation of a **community maintenance fund** (e.g., small user fee).

### **Scale**

- Pilot acts as a **replicable model** for other Sudanese neighborhoods.
- Potential for a **network of resilient, self-sufficient communities**.
